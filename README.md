# SNAKE

SNAKE is a fun and common video game, which does not require a lot of code. This is an implementation  of the game.


## Rules of the game

The player controls a red headed snake, which roams around the board picking up green apples. By eating, the snake grow in length.

Use 'w', 's', 'a', 'd', or touch inside the canvas to move the snake.

It's GAME OVER if the snake run into its own tail.

Hitting the border doesn't lose you the game: the snake will simply reappear on the other side!
