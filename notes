                    <h3>Rules of Snake</h3>
                    The player controls a snake with red head and yellow tail.<br> The snake wants to eat the green apples the spawn on the board from time to time.<br> Each apple earns you a full point!
                    
                    The snake eats by running into the apples with its head; but if it runs into its own body it's GAME OVER!

                    <h3>Game option</h3>
                    Normal: after eating an apple, the speed of snake increase!<br>
                    Relax: the speed of the game is constant.
